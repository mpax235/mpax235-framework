# lastFM
This functions retrieves the latest track name, album, and artist form the specified username. A last.fm API key is required for this to work. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpaxfw.lastFM('[apiKey], [username]');`

Where `apiKey` is the API key you are required to put in, and `username` for the username you want to retrieve the latest track from.

For security reasons, there will be no example. However to get the code to work, you need to put in a valid last.fm API key in the `apiKey` parameter, then put your specified username in the `username` parameter.
