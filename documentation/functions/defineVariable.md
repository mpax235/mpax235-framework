# defineVariable
This function defines a variable with the specified name and value. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpawfw.defineVariable('[variableName]', [value]);`

Where `variableName` is the name you want and `value` for the value you want.

For example, if the name would be `mpax235` and the value would be `100`, it would be:

`mpaxfw.defineVariable('mpax235', 100);`
