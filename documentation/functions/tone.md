# tone
This function plays a tone with the specified length (in seconds) and frequency (in Hz). To use this function, use the following code:

`mpaxfw.tone([frequency], [seconds]);`

Where `frequency` is the frequency you want in Hz, and `seconds` for the duration of the frequency in seconds.

For example, if the frequency was 1000Hz and the duration was 1 second, it would be:

`mpaxfw.tone(1000, 1);`
