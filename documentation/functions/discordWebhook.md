# discordWebhook
This function sends a message to a specified Discord webhook url. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpawfw.discordWebhook('[url]', '[message]');`

Where `url` is the url you want to send it to, and `message` for the message you want it to say.

For security reasons, there will be no example. However to get the code to work, you need to put in a valid Discord webhook url in the `url` parameter, then put your specified message in the `message` parameter.
