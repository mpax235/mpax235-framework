# turnOnCamera
This function creates a video with your camera output. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpawfw.turnOnCamera([width], [height], '[id]');`

Where `width` is the width, `height` is the height, and `id` is the id.

For example, if you want to create a video with your camera output with a width of `640`, height of `480`, and a id of `camera`, it would be:

`mpaxfw.turnOnCamera(640, 480, 'camera');`
