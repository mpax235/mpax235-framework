# createCanvas
This function creates a canvas with the specified width, height, and background color. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpawfw.createCanvas([width], [height], '[backgroundcolor]');`

Where `width` is the width you want, `height` for the height you want, and `backgroundcolor` for the background color you want.

For example, if the width and height was 200, and the background color is `#00ffff`, it would be:

`mpaxfw.createCanvas(200, 200, '#00ffff');`
