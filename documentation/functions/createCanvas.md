# createCanvas
This function creates a canvas with the specified width, height, and background color. To use this function, use the following code:

`mpaxfw.createCanvas('[id]', [width], [height], '[backgroundcolor]');`

Where `id` is the id you want, `width` is the width you want, `height` for the height you want, and `backgroundcolor` for the background color you want.

For example, if the id was `mpaxCanvas`, the width and height was 200, and the background color is `#00ffff`, it would be:

`mpaxfw.createCanvas('mpaxCanvas', 200, 200, '#00ffff');`
